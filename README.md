# Overdrop - JavaScript Practical Project

## Overview

Overdrop is an amazing JavaScript Application. This App will allow users to exactly know the temperature in celsius degree of any city in the world. The user simply inputs any city name and then hit search. This project was really light and easy, I built it in just two days and it gave me so much trust in my abilities and more will to push forward and write more projects.
